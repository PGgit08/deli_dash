cryptography falls into 3 types of algorithms:

symmetric key
asymmetric key
hash functions

symmetric key: uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt text
asymmetric key: same as symmetric key but uses two different keys
hash functions: just encode data and thats it

Ciphers:
transposition: character and bits are moved to another location
substitution: characters are subsituded

common cipher algorithms:
ceaser cipher 
vigenere
railfence
